# AI-Based Student Attendance System on videos

This project is an AI-powered student attendance system that uses video footage to recognize students' faces and automates the attendance process. It makes use of a variety of cutting-edge technologies, including Python, C#, JavaScript, and frameworks like ASP.NET Core, Flask, and Vue. This project was build for my graduation thesis at HCMC University of Science, scored 9.8/10 by thesis committee.
